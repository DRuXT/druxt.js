> DruxtJS provides an easy connection between a Drupal JSON:API backend and Nuxt.js frontend application.

## Drupal JSON:API client

Two methods of communication with the Drupal JSON:API are provided by Druxt, a framework agnostic [**DruxtClient**](/api/client) and the [**DruxtStore**](/api/stores/druxt) Vuex module, which adds an additional cache layer.

See the [Guide](/guide) and [API Documentation](/api) for details.


## Themable modules

Druxt uses a Module and slot-based Wrapper component system, making it easy to render and theme Drupal data.

Find more details in the [Guide](/guide)


## Community support

Druxt is an open source project, built by the comunity for the community.

Find support or get involved in building Druxt via the community channels:
- [DruxtJS Discord server](https://discord.druxtjs.org)
- **#druxt** Slack channel on [Drupal.org slack](https://drupal.org/slack)


## Fully decoupled Drupal sites

The [**DruxtSite**](https://site.druxtjs.org) module provides minimal configuration, decoupled Drupal site functionality.
